# Project FAQ

## What is this?
The idea is to capture the array of things we think about.  Maybe one month you are thinking about your kid's education, or a book you read, something in the news, a home project, work related stuff, workouts, etc.  Maybe several months are the same thing.  

This project asks you to share what that is once a month for twelve months (January–December 2026).

## How do I participate?
Then, once a month, send me your contribution.  
Each month’s contribution is due on the **first day of the following month**  
(e.g. January → February 1, February → March 1, etc.).

## When does it run?
Contributions for January–December 2026, submitted Feb 2026–Jan 2027.

## Where does it happen?
Email, or through the regular mail

## Can I edit/change my submission after the fact? 
Let's pretend you can't but if need be you can.    

## What format does my submission need to be in?
Any format you can deliver to me.  Anything that can arrive in an email or a text or through the post office.

## Can I change formats (writing/photo/video) month to month? 
Yes

## Is this supposed to be formal (an essay or letter) or informal (notes, lists, unpolished ideas/observations)?
Anyway you choose.  Getting something in is the achievement.  

## Can I invite someone
Yes.  Invite your neighbor, you best friend, your coworker, your kids.  You are free to manage their contributions or send me their info.

## What's going to happen to all this?
I don't know yet.  I suspect seeing what comes will inspire a direction.

## Can I remain anonymous
Yes.  I do need permission to thread each person's contributions together but we can use a pseudonym. E.g., you get randomly assigned a name like anon24 that each contribution is credited to.
