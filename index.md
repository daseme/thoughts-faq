# Project FAQ

## What is this?
There's that thing you see out of the corner of your eye that you keep thinking about.  

This project asks you to share what that is once a month for twelve months (January–December 2026).

What has your attention?  What are you thinking about? You can send a single word, a sentence, or pages of text, an image, a sound file,  a postcard a poem.  Whatever makes sense to you.  You decide what "what are you are thinking about" means.  

## How do I participate?
Then, once a month, send me your contribution.  
Each month’s contribution is due on the **first day of the following month**  
(e.g. January → February 1, February → March 1, etc.).

## When does it run?
Contributions for January–December 2026, submitted Feb 2026–Jan 2027.

## Where does it happen?
Email, or through the regular mail

## What do I need?
A thought.  

## Who’s organizing this?
You know who.  I invited you.

## Can I invite someone
Yes.  Invite your neighbor, you best friend, your coworker, your kids.  You are free to manage their contributions or send me their info.

## What's going to happen to all this?
I don't know yet.  I suspect seeing what comes will inspire a direction.

## Hey, I'm worried about privacy
If you don't want to use your name that's fine.  I do need permission to thread each person's contributions together but we can use a pseudonym.
